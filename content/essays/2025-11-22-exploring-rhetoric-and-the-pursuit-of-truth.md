## Exploring Rhetoric

Rhetoric is a powerful tool for achieving one's goal of convincing people. As Aristotle once stated, "Rhetoric, then, may be defined as the faculty of discovering the possible means of persuasion about any subject" (Rhetoric (Freese)/Book 1, 2010). This implies that rhetoric is not confined to a particular topic but can be used to persuade on a wide range of subjects. Using persuasive language or rhetoric can have many benefits, such as negotiating a better deal, convincing someone to buy my product, supporting a cause, or conducting a job interview.

Some good examples of rhetoric are Nike's "Just Do it" advertisements, Iraq-Afghan wartime speeches, or getting a speech from the commanding officer. Advertising campaigns use emotional appeal to sell products or sad donation videos. Celebrities are used in product commercials like during the Superbowl. When watching a movie, they purposely put a product advertisement in a shot or advertisements with catchy jingles that get stuck in your head. If you were alive in the 1970s and aware of the pop culture at the time, the Hertz commercial with famous football player OJ Simpson: Using personal credibility to persuade others in a leadership role, like convincing a hiring manager you are the right candidate based on your BS degree, certifications, and previous experience.

Other examples of rhetoric include political speeches that sway public opinion, such as those of Malcolm X, who influenced thousands of black Americans in the 1960s, or Steve Jobs's Apple product launch presentation. Using all three modes of persuasion is a well-rounded approach to effective communication, crafting compelling arguments. From convincing friends to watch a particular movie based on its reviews, like Fifth Element starring Bruce Willis, the most excellent film of all time, or creating a business website to attract and persuade customers.

Utilizing personal credibility and expertise to negotiate a deal or persuade stakeholders to support a business strategy demonstrates ethos in a professional setting. For a small business, you use personal credibility and expertise to pitch a software solution to a client, emphasizing relevant experience and successful project delivery to establish ethos in the technology domain. Public figures such as JD Vance and Barack Obama use logical reasoning to support their debate arguments.

In the film *Remember the Titans*, Denzel Washington, who plays a football coach leading a racially integrated high school football team, embodies ethos, pathos, and logos. Rhetoric is everywhere and anyone who listens to music is given a ton of rhetoric in the music. In the song "Changes" by 2Pac, the artist uses logical reasoning (logos) to critique societal and political issues, making a persuasive argument for change. Another example of music is Metallica's song "One." The band addresses social issues and injustice, appealing to the audience's sense of ethics and morality (ethos).

Despite the positive changes rhetoric can have, some critics claim that rhetoric is manipulative and is often used for malicious purposes, leading to unethical behavior and undermining truth. Some argue that leaning too much toward one method of persuasion, such as pathos, can lack logic, or leaning too much on logos can lack emotion and overlook the ethical aspects of a problem. Others argue that relying solely on the credibility of an authority figure without considering the evidence or arguments can lead to flawed reasoning and potentially inaccurate conclusions. Critics of rhetoric argue that emotional appeals undermine rational decision-making and can exploit people's emotions, leading them to irrational decision-making, which can obscure essential facts and information about a product or mislead consumers, hindering their decision-making and making people have impulsive actions.

## Seeking Wisdom and Truth

Seeking wisdom and truth is a fundamental aspect of moral goodness that aligns with human Nature. Humans have an inherent drive to seek the truth, even in adversity, and finding the truth is essential for a fulfilling and happy life. As Cicero once said, "Above all, the search for truth and its eager pursuit are peculiar to man. When we have leisure from the demands of daily life, we are eager to see, hear, and learn something new. We regard the desire to uncover the secrets and wonders of creation as indispensable to a happy life" (Cicero, 44 B.C.E./1913, p. 4).

For example, someone pursuing higher education for personal growth and advocating for education illustrates the human drive to understand and learn more. Examples of pursuing a fulfilling, happy life are doing academic research in and out of school needed for career advancement or change, planning my finances, and researching health and wellness trends. Finding truth and knowledge to stop wars. The movie *Oppenheimer* showcases one relentless pursuit of scientific knowledge and truth with some moral elements of using the bomb during wartime.

Like any other animal, humans possess a unique ability to recognize and value Moral Sensibility. Unlike any other animal, humans possess a unique ability to recognize and value Moral Sensibility. Humans perform general acts of kindness, volunteering, donating, recycling, standing up against social injustice, being honest, and advocating for environmental protection. In pop culture, in the movies *Liar Liar*, *Fun with Dick and Jane*, and *Ace Ventura*, Jim Carey where comes into the situation of doing the right thing, all pretty good elements of moral sensibility with a comedic approach.

However, morality may be viewed differently by different cultures. One society may deem something morally good that may not be bad. Another may see something as good but harmful, leading to a conflict of morality. The movie *Snowden* showcases moral dilemmas and pursuing the truth. Some may argue that truth can be manipulated or distorted by propaganda and spreading misinformation, especially in modern times. Knowing the truth may not fulfill someone in life. Some may argue that truth can be manipulated or distorted by propaganda and spreading misinformation, especially in modern times. Others argue that revealing truths can sometimes have negative consequences and a harmful relationship undermines trust. Truth can also be subjective in various cultures.
